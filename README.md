# âœ… Day 15 of #gfg160 - Add Two Binary Strings
## ðŸ§  Problem:
You are given two binary strings. Return their sum (also a binary string).

## ðŸ“œ Approach:
1. Start from the end of both strings.

2. Add corresponding bits plus any carry.

3. Store the result bit and update the carry.

4. Continue until all bits and carry are processed.

5. Reverse the result at the end to get the correct binary sum.

## ðŸš€ Key Takeaways:
1. Seamless handling of carry during binary addition âœ…

2. Elegant reverse traversal and result formation âœ…

3. Smartly stripping leading zeros âœ…
